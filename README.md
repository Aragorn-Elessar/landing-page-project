## project description

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Prerequisites

Any code editor (e.g: VSCode, Atom,... etc)

## Installing

Terminal commands to start using project:

- Get a copy on your machine
```
`git clone https://github.com/Aragorn-Elessar/landing-page-project.git`
```
- Call into the directory location
```
`cd landing-page-project`
```
- Opens code in `VSCode`
```
`code .`
```

## Changes

- New section has been created in `index.html`

- Added helping function to check if a specific section is in the viewport

- Added helping function to `add/remove` active status from sections & navbar list

- Created navbar list elements, anchor elements, and included style classes and links to sections

- Created an event to listen for `scroll` event and add active class to the navbar/section in view

- Added smooth scrolling to navbar anchors
